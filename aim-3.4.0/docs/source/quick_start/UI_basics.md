## UI Basics

Aim enables powerful UI to explore logged ML runs and metadata.

### Runs explorer
Runs explorer will help you to hollistically view all your [runs](./SDK_basics.html#create-a-run), each metric last tracked values and tracked hyperparameters.

Features:
- Full Research context at hand
- Search runs by date, experiment, hash, tag or parameters
- Search by run/experiment

### Metrics explorer
Metrics explorer helps you to compare 100s of metrics within a few clicks.
It helps to save lots of time compared to other open-source experiment tracking tools.

Features:
- Easily query any metric
- Group by any parameter
- Divide into subplots
- Aggregate grouped metrics (by conf. interval, std. dev., std. err., min/max)
- Apply smoothing
- Change scale of the axes (linear or log)
- Align metrics by time, epoch or another metric

### Images explorer
Track intermediate images and search, compare them on the Images Explorer.

Features:
- Easily query any image
- Group by images by run parameters
- Group images by step

### Params explorer
Params explorer enables a parallel coordinates view for metrics and params. Very helpful when doing hyperparameter search.

Features:
- Easily query any metrics and params
- Group runs or divide into subplots
- Apply chart indicator to see correlations

### Single run page
Explore all the metadata associated with a run on the single run page.
It's accessible from all the tables and tooltips.

Features:
- See all the logged params of a run
- See all the tracked metrics(including system metrics)
