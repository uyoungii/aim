### Democratizing AI Dev tools

#### The mission...
Aim's mission is to democratize AI dev tools.
We believe that the best AI tools need to be:
- open-source, open-data-format, community-driven, extensible
- have great UI/UX, CLI and other interfaces for automation
- performant both on UI and data

#### Our motivation...
Existing open-source tools (TensorBoard, MLFlow) are super-inspiring.

However we see lots of improvements to be made. Especially around issues like:
- ability to handle 1000s of large-scale experiments
- actionable, beautiful and performant visualizations
- extensibility - how easy are the apis for extension/democratization?

These problems are a huge motivation.

We are inspired to build beautiful, scalable AI dev tools with great APIs.
That's what unites the Aim community.

Join us, help us build the future of AI tooling!
